// Package leaderelection implements a leader election protocol in Go using the Zookeeper leader election recipe.
// The main steps to implement a leader election as as follows:
//
// Initialize an election
//
// Before leader election can take place the election needs to be initialized. This involves providing a live connection
// to Zookeeper and an existing Zookeeper node (resource) that represents the top level of the election to the NewElection function.
//
//	election, err := NewElection(zkConn, "/election")
//
// In the above example if zkConn is not valid or "/election" doesn't already exist an error will be
// returned.
//
// Run an election
//
// Running an election will register this election instance as interested in becoming leader for the election resource
// that was provided in the call to NewElection (e.g., "/election"). Multiple candidates may be registered for the same
// election resource and contend for leadership of the resource. One will be chosen as the leader and the rest will
// become followers. In the event that the leader exits prior to the election terminating one of the followers will
// become leader. Example:
//
//	go leaderElector.ElectLeader()
//
// This registers the candidate that created the election instance as a potential leader for the election resource. As
// it is started as a goroutine the candidate is expected to monitor one of several election related channels for
// election events.
//
// Events that can happen while an election is running
//
// There are several channels that must be monitored during an election. The first is the channel returned by
// election.Status(). This channel is used to indicate to a follower that it has become leader. It is also used to
// signal the end of the election. This signaling occurs when the Election instance closes the Status() channel. When
// election end has been signaled via the closing of the Status() channel the client is expected to stop using the
// election. Errors may also be returned via the Status() channel. Errors generally indicate there has
// been a problem with the election. A network partition from Zookeeper is an example of an error that may occur.
// Errors are unrecoverable and mean the election is over for that candidate. The connFailCh highlights that the
// client owns the Zookeeper connection and is responsible for handling any errors associated with the Zookeeper
// connection.
//
//	for {
//		select {
//		case status, ok = <- leaderElector.Status():
//			if !ok {
//			fmt.Println("\t\t\tChannel closed, election is terminated!!!")
//			leaderElector.Resign()
//			return
//			}
//			if status.Err != nil {
//				fmt.Println("Received election status error <<", status.Err, ">> for candidate <", leaderElector.candidateID, ">.")
//				leaderElector.Resign()
//				return
//			}
//			fmt.Println("Candidate received status message: <", status, ">.")
//			if status.Role == Leader {
//				doLeaderStuff(leaderElector, status, respCh, connFailCh, waitFor)
//				leaderElection.EndElection() // Terminates the election and signals all followers the election is over.
//				return
//			}
//		case <-connFailCh:
//			fmt.Println("\t\t\tZK connection failed for candidate <", status.CandidateID, ">, exiting")
//			respCh <- ElectionResponse{false, status.CandidateID}
//			leaderElector.Resign()
//			wg.Done()
//			return
//
//		case ... // Any other channels the client may need to monitor.
//		...
//		}
//	}
//
// The for-ever loop indicates that the election continues until one of the halting conditions described above occurs.
// The "case <- connFailCh:" branch is used to monitor for Zookeeper connection problems. It is up to the client to
// decide what to do in this event.
//
// On channel close or Error events the client is expected to resign from the election as shown in the above code
// snippet. When the leader is done with the work associated with the election it is expected to terminate the election
// by calling the EndElection method. This is required to properly clean up election resources including termination
// of any existing followers.
